# Full-history backfill for stats.wnba.com league-dash data (WNBA only --
# NBA backfill lives in hoopR-nba-stats-data/scripts/leaguedash_backfill.sh
# since they're separate producer repos, mirroring the hoopR/wehoop split).
# Run this DIRECTLY in your own terminal from a residential IP -- NOT via Claude,
# NOT in the background. It is a multi-hour, rate-limited job.
#
# Season floor below (1997, the WNBA's inaugural season) is a domain-
# knowledge estimate, NOT verified against a live stats.wnba.com response in
# this session -- the scraper's own per-variant try/except + empty-frame skip
# absorbs a wrong guess for free (a pre-history season just logs
# "leaguedash_empty"/"skip" and costs a little rate-limit budget). Narrow
# --start/--end below if you'd rather not spend that budget probing the
# edges. 2024/2025 are already seeded -- START defaults to 1997 and stops at
# 2023 so this never re-scrapes them.
#
# Resumable: safe to Ctrl-C and re-run. Each season is a separate `uv run`
# invocation; completion is tracked via a ".done_<season>" sentinel (NOT
# player_master_<season>.parquet -- some seasons genuinely have no data
# beyond standings, e.g. the WNBA's earliest, so that file never gets
# written and a marker keyed on it would re-attempt that season forever).
# The sentinel is only written when the CLI exits 0 -- a real publish
# failure correctly leaves the season unmarked and it retries on the next
# run instead of silently reporting done. --publish runs after EVERY
# season, so progress is banked upstream incrementally, not just sitting
# on local disk for hours.
set -uo pipefail   # no -e: one bad season must not kill the whole backfill
