# Program V (design section 10.4, D26d) operator runbook: the v3 -> production
# release-tag cutover.
#
# Usage: scripts/run_v3_cutover.sh [-s START] [-e END] [-x] [-R] [-L] [-- EXTRA...]
#   -s START  first season (default 1997, calendar year)
#   -e END    last season  (default 2026, calendar year)
#   -x        EXECUTE. WITHOUT IT THIS IS A DRY RUN.
#   -R        SEPARATE STEP: retire the _v3 tags (no data upload). With -x, deletes.
#   -L        SEPARATE STEP: retire the LEGACY unprefixed assets superseded by the
#             publish (no data upload). With -x, deletes. Refuses any season whose
#             wnba_-prefixed replacement is not present and verified in every format.
#   --        everything after is passed through (e.g. --allow-diff 2011:schedule)
#
# DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. A dry run re-runs the section-10.3 gate, derives the
# release formats, writes the REPLACE MANIFEST to logs/, and uploads nothing.
# Read the manifest's "WOULD BE DESTROYED" and "SEASON-LABEL COLLISION" sections
# before ever passing -x -- overwriting a release asset destroys the previous
# bytes and wehoop::load_wnba_*() reads them.
#
# Publishes parquet + rds + csv.gz for every artifact (wehoop reads the .rds; the
# csv is gzipped to stay clear of GitHub's 2 GiB per-asset limit). The rds is
# verified by reading it back before it is ever uploaded.
#
# Decision B: the publish is ADDITIVE -- the wnba_-prefixed assets land next to the
# legacy unprefixed ones, so an all-NEW / 0-REPLACE manifest is expected. Each
# touched tag gets a generated README.md naming both patterns. Retire the legacy
# names later with -L, never in the same run.
#
# Resumable + idempotent: verified uploads are recorded in
# v3_staging/.cutover_receipts.json and skipped on a re-run. On the first
# size mismatch the run stops rather than continuing through the queue.
