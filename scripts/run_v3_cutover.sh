# Program V (design section 10.4, D26d) operator runbook: the v3 -> production
# release-tag cutover.
#
# Usage: scripts/run_v3_cutover.sh [-s START] [-e END] [-x] [-R] [-- EXTRA...]
#   -s START  first END-year season (default 1997)
#   -e END    last END-year season  (default 2026)
#   -x        EXECUTE the publish. WITHOUT IT THIS IS A DRY RUN.
#   -R        SEPARATE STEP: retire the _v3 tags (no data upload). With -x, deletes.
#   --        everything after is passed through (e.g. --allow-diff 2011:schedule)
#
# DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. A dry run re-runs the section-10.3 gate, writes the
# REPLACE MANIFEST to logs/, and uploads nothing. Read the manifest's
# "WOULD BE DESTROYED" section before ever passing -x -- overwriting a release
# asset destroys the previous bytes and wehoop::load_wnba_*() reads them.
#
# Resumable + idempotent: verified uploads are recorded in
# v3_staging/.cutover_receipts.json and skipped on a re-run. On the first
# size mismatch the run stops rather than continuing through the queue.
