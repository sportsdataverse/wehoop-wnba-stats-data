"""Publish floors + the SPM coefficient sidecar (hermetic — no network, no model compute).

Diff-ported from the NBA twin minus the oracle family, which this league does
not have (see ``wnba_model_publish/gates.py``). Player counts here mirror the
WNBA's real scale (~160 rated players a season, not ~500), so a fixture that
silently assumed NBA-sized samples would not pass unnoticed.

The floors themselves were derived from the real published release (see
``wnba_model_publish/gates.py``); these tests pin the MACHINERY: a degraded
build fails, an uncomputable metric is SKIPPED rather than PASS, and the
gate blocks the publish path instead of merely printing.
