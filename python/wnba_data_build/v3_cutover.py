"""Program V (design §10, D26d) cutover publisher: staged v3 -> production release tags.

**DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT.** Nothing is uploaded, created, or deleted without an
explicit ``--execute``. This is the least reversible action in the program:
overwriting a GitHub release asset destroys the previous bytes, and the
downstream consumers are ``wehoop::load_wnba_*()`` + ``sportsdataverse.wnba``
loaders.

What it does, in order:

1. **Gate.** Re-runs the section-10.3 :mod:`.v3_gate` over the requested season
   range. Any ``DIFF`` / ``MISSING_STAGED`` verdict aborts unless that exact
   ``season:family`` pair was allowlisted with ``--allow-diff`` -- which is then
   printed verbatim in the manifest. There is no blanket ignore switch.
2. **Manifest.** Writes a REPLACE MANIFEST (markdown) naming every asset that
   would be uploaded: target tag, filename, local bytes/rows/sha256, and the
   CURRENT remote asset's size + updated-at when one exists. Every row is
   classified ``NEW`` / ``REPLACE`` / ``UNCHANGED``. A dedicated section lists
   the remote assets that would be **destroyed**, and a second lists the
   legacy-named assets that would survive un-replaced and keep being served to
   the loaders (the shadow set).
3. **Upload** (``--execute`` only). One asset at a time; after each, the release
   is re-fetched and the remote size compared to the local file. First mismatch
   stops the run -- ``gh release upload`` with many files at once has silently
   dropped large assets before, which is why this is per-file.

Resumability: every verified upload appends a receipt to
``{staging}/.cutover_receipts.json``. A re-run classifies an asset ``UNCHANGED``
(and skips it) only when a receipt's sha256 matches the local file *and* the
remote size agrees -- size equality alone is never taken as identity.

``_v3`` tag retirement is a **separate** invocation (``--retire-v3-tags``), never
bundled into a data upload.

Seasons are **calendar years**, matching :mod:`.v3_backfill` -- the NBA sibling's
END-year span convention does not apply here, and the legacy production assets
use the same year (``legacy_offset=0`` throughout).
