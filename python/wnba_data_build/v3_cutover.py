"""Program V (design §10, D26d) cutover publisher: staged v3 -> production release tags.

**DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT.** Nothing is uploaded, created, or deleted without an
explicit ``--execute``. This is the least reversible action in the program:
overwriting a GitHub release asset destroys the previous bytes, and the
downstream consumers are ``wehoop::load_wnba_*()`` + ``sportsdataverse.wnba``
loaders.

What it does, in order:

1. **Gate.** Re-runs the section-10.3 :mod:`.v3_gate` over the requested season
   range. Any ``DIFF`` / ``MISSING_STAGED`` verdict aborts unless that exact
   ``season:family`` pair was allowlisted with ``--allow-diff`` -- which is then
   printed verbatim in the manifest. There is no blanket ignore switch.
2. **Derive.** Every staged parquet is materialized in all three published
   formats (:mod:`.v3_formats`): ``parquet`` + ``rds`` + ``csv.gz``. The rds is
   what ``wehoop::load_wnba_*()`` actually reads, so a parquet-only publish
   would ship data wehoop cannot open; it is written by the byte-parity RDS
   writer (no R, no ``Rscript``) and **verified by reading it back** before it
   is considered done.
3. **Manifest.** Writes a REPLACE MANIFEST (markdown) naming every asset that
   would be uploaded: target tag, filename, local bytes/rows/sha256, and the
   CURRENT remote asset's size + updated-at when one exists. Every row is
   classified ``NEW`` / ``REPLACE`` / ``UNCHANGED``. Dedicated sections list the
   remote assets that would be **destroyed**, the legacy-named assets that
   survive un-replaced and keep being served to the loaders (the shadow set),
   and the **season-label collisions** (below).
4. **Upload** (``--execute`` only). One asset at a time; after each, the release
   is re-fetched and the remote size compared to the local file. First mismatch
   stops the run -- ``gh release upload`` with many files at once has silently
   dropped large assets before, which is why this is per-file. Each touched tag
   also receives a generated ``README.md`` explaining the two naming schemes.

**Decision B -- additive publish.** The v3 assets land on the PRODUCTION tags
alongside the existing legacy assets rather than replacing them, and consumers
migrate afterwards. A 0-REPLACE / all-NEW manifest is therefore the intended
outcome, not a defect. It leaves each tag serving two files that cover the same
season under different names -- here they at least agree on the *number*
(``legacy_offset=0``; the NBA sibling's legacy names are START-year and really do
disagree), but a consumer still has to know which of ``play_by_play_1997.*`` and
``wnba_play_by_play_1997.*`` is authoritative. Three mitigations, all in this
module:

* the **SEASON-LABEL COLLISION** manifest section pairs every new asset with the
  legacy asset covering the same season, per tag, and flags which pairs
  additionally disagree on the season number;
* ``--execute`` uploads a generated per-tag ``README.md`` stating which pattern
  is which, that both describe the same seasons, that the ``wnba_``-prefixed
  name is authoritative, and that the legacy assets are scheduled for removal;
* ``--retire-legacy-assets`` deletes the legacy names once consumers have
  migrated -- a **separate** invocation that refuses to delete anything whose
  replacement is not present and verified in all three formats.

Resumability: every verified upload appends a receipt to
``{staging}/.cutover_receipts.json``. A re-run classifies an asset ``UNCHANGED``
(and skips it) only when a receipt's sha256 matches the local file *and* the
remote size agrees -- size equality alone is never taken as identity.

``_v3`` tag retirement (``--retire-v3-tags``) and legacy-asset retirement
(``--retire-legacy-assets``) are each a separate invocation, never bundled into
a data upload and never into each other.

Seasons are **calendar years**, matching :mod:`.v3_backfill` -- the NBA sibling's
END-year span convention does not apply here, and the legacy production assets
use the same year (``legacy_offset=0`` throughout).
