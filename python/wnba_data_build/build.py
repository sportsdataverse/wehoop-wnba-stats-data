"""Reshape raw-store captures into the published season frames.

Pure functions over payloads already on disk — no network, so a season compiles
from a fixture tree and every builder is testable offline.

Season-level datasets are one payload per season, optionally spread over parameter
variants (measure type x season type x per mode) which are bound into a single
frame with the varying parameters carried as columns. Game-level datasets are one
payload per game, bound per season.
