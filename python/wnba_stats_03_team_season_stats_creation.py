"""Stage 03 -- team_season_stats.

Thin shim over the tested build package: the pipeline logic lives in
``wnba_data_build``; this file exists so the stage sequence is readable from a
directory listing.

Stage numbers follow the ``DATASETS`` registry order in
``wnba_data_build/datasets.py``, which is the intended build order --
``shots`` (15) derives from ``pbp`` (10). The number is a stable dataset
identity, NOT an execution schedule: the daily driver builds every dataset in
one invocation and remains the sequence truth.

Equivalent to::

    python -m wnba_data_build --datasets team_season_stats --seasons <year>
